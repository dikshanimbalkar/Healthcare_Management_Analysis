INTRODUCTION

Diabetes is one of the top 10 causes of death globally according to World Health Organization.

The number of new patients and re-admitted patients is raising year by year significantly. 

Therefore, the pressure for hospital management is also increased to be able to serve patients in all conditions.

Some of the concerns from the management are:

◆ The hospital's performance in managing the hospital capacity for all patients.

◆ Budgeting the procedures and specialists for each patient case.

◆ How patients are treated regardless of their race and identification for better care.

◆ The success rate for emergency cases.

◆ Summarize patients’ history for the overall views.
